• 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)

• Ice cubes

• Coconut flakes or chocolate shavings (optional, for garnish)


Instructions:

Tips for Customization:

• Adjust Sweetness:  Start with a smaller amount of sweetener and gradually increase to your preferred level of sweetness.

• Experiment with Flavor: Add a dash of cinnamon, cardamom, or a pinch of nutmeg for a spiced twist.

• Boost the Creaminess: For a richer, creamier texture, use full-fat coconut milk.

• Make it Dairy-Free: This recipe is naturally dairy-free, making it a great option for those with dietary restrictions.

• Use Cold Brew: Cold brew coffee offers a naturally smoother and less acidic flavor profile, which pairs well with coconut milk.
